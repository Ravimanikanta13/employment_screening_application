			Employment Screening <br> Consent Declaration
		</h1>
		<h3 style="margin: 25px;">Please read the following statements
			carefully and then confirm your consent by signing and dating the
			form below.</h3>
		<p style="margin: 25px;">
			I understand and agree that my personal information will be used for
			the purpose of employment screening as set out below. This
			information will not be disclosed for any other purpose without my
			express permission. <br> I understand that Know Your Candidate
			will process my data in accordance with its privacy policy which can
			be viewed at www.knowyourcandidate.co.uk/privacy-policy
		</p>
		<h4 style="margin: 25px;">I authorise you, Know Your Candidate
			Ltd and your representatives to carry out the following background
			checks as specified by my current / prospective employer or
			organisations working on their behalf:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Checks on my employment history, education, professional

			<li>Other background checks specified which could include a
				credit check, identity check, criminal record check, sanctions
				check, directorship check, adverse media check and passport check.</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="margin: 25px;">Where a Basic Criminal Record Check is
			specified you give Know Your Candidate consent to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use your personal data for the purpose of obtaining a
				disclosure;</li>
			<li>Your disclosure certificate to be dispatched to Know Your
				Candidate instead of your home address;</li>

		<p style="margin: 25px;">I authorise all previous employers,
			educational institutions, professional institutions, credit reference
			agencies,government organisations and others to provide information
			about me (including information about my employment, education,
			credit history, criminal records and other public records) to Know

			working on their behalf. Where my application is to an organisation
			based overseas or their head office is based overseas I consent to
			this information being transferred to them at their specified
			location.</p>

			specified we use credit reference agencies and fraud prevention
			agencies who may supply to us public information and fraud prevention
			information. A search ‘footprint’ will be recorded on your credit
			report; this will have no impact on your ability to obtain credit in
			the future. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud
			is suspected or identified this may be recorded and may be passed to
			fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime
			and fraud prevention.</p>
		<p style="margin: 25px;">I declare that the information I have
			provided in my application is true and complete to the best of my
			knowledge. I understand that the provision of false and misleading
			information may lead to the withdrawal of the employment offer or, if
			appointed, to disciplinary action or termination of my employment
			contract.</p>
